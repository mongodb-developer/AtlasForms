## Introduction

Atlas forms is a Forms based, End user interface to allow users to Create, Find, Update, Delete and Link Records. It is similar to a Fourth Generation Language (4GL) in that it abstracts away all
database development where required and makes a Zero Coding solution to building an internal GUI
to interact with Data.

It differs from a 4GL in having no proprietery coding language - it si instead a skeleton application in modern Javascript running with serverless function on MongoDBs Atlas Developer Data PLatform. It is intended to be modified to fit rewuirements and has been designed to me modular and easily modified.

## Installation



Change xxxab to your own appid throught this repo and import.


## Known BUGS to fix

- Offer sensible message if appid not set correctly.



## Improvements we could implement

- Offer list of collections in AF_DocTypes
- ~~Allow Links to be labeled?~~ 

- Look at non Atlas hosting options for frontend
- 
- Optimise speed of server calls, 'Security' is slow in Global app due to fetch of user record.

- Error Handling review, Refactor, lint,tidy code
  - Make Errors and Messages seperate so message shown if provided regardless of error state
  - Can then provide positive messages - your form submitted with reference ABC

- All Strings in a consts class, inc errors and fieldnames

- Hide buttons
  - If a user doesn't have the permissions to do something, hide the buttons related to that, eg. no write permissions should mean edit  and create are hidden

- Mobile Layout CSS/swipes (Lots of this bootstrap gives us)

- Listview
  - Choose Columns by User 

- FormView
    - Formview rememeber personal layout changes
    - Controls
      - boolean support (button/box)
      - Show URLs?? , This may be super hard for edits so we may need 'Virtual' fields which show content of others.
      - Constraints & Validation 
        - On on Change as well as Submit (Download JS to client??)
    - Date Only Chooser
    
- Printing (Stylesheet to render to printer) - Actually it's not too bad right now but we need 
to disable scrolls and it only does one page. And we dont want ot print the hitlist.

- Charts Integration (Requested but not relevant for now)
- Accessability
